# Gemini Development Session Summary

This document summarizes the development tasks completed during our session.

## 1. Core Functionality (CRUD Modules)

### Article Management
- **Delete:** Implemented the backend API (soft delete) and frontend logic for deleting articles, including a confirmation dialog.
- **Edit:** Implemented the backend API for fetching and updating articles. Created a shared `ArticleEditorForm` component and a dedicated editing page (`/articles/edit/[id]`). Added the ability to modify the article type.
- **Create:** Reviewed and validated the existing new article creation flow.

### Book Management
- Created a complete CRUD module for managing books from scratch.
- **Backend:** Developed the full API stack (Repository, Service, Handler, Routes) for book create, read, update, and delete operations.
- **Frontend:** Built all necessary UI pages, including a book list, new book page, and edit book page, all utilizing a reusable `BookEditorForm` component.

## 2. UI/UX & Layout Overhaul

- **Application Layout:** Refactored the admin panel into a modern, full-featured application layout using Ant Design's components. The final version features a full-width top header and a nested sidebar.
- **Dark Mode:** Implemented a fully functional light/dark theme switcher. This included synchronizing the Ant Design theme system with the project's Tailwind CSS theme system.
- **Component Styling:** 
  - Refined the action buttons (Edit/Delete) in all data tables to use a cleaner, icon-based style with tooltips.
  - Relocated the sidebar collapse trigger from the bottom of the sidebar to a more conventional hamburger-menu icon in the main header.

## 3. Dashboard & Analytics

- **Initial Implementation:** Built a dashboard featuring a line chart to display daily page view trends, with options to filter by the last 7, 30, or 365 days.
- **Enhancements:** Added a data table below the chart to serve as a leaderboard for page views by path.
- **Final State:** Per user request, the dashboard was ultimately reverted to a simpler, table-only view displaying the page view leaderboard.

## 4. Bug Fixing & Debugging

Throughout the session, numerous bugs and issues were addressed:
- Fixed data integrity between frontend and backend (e.g., integer scores for books).
- Resolved multiple UI bugs related to layout, scrolling, and component alignment.
- Corrected data mapping issues in the backend API (e.g., `null` values in chart data).
- Fixed theme-related style bugs (e.g., text color in dark mode, button colors).

## 5. Unresolved Issue
- The session concluded with a persistent and unusual React hydration error ("Warning: You are mounting a new body component...").
- We systematically ruled out all common causes through static code analysis. The final diagnosis is that this is a deep issue likely related to the project's specific dependencies or runtime environment, which requires interactive, browser-based debugging to resolve.
